# ABOUT
 This repository contains bare-metal firmware for a Cortex-M4 STM32 microcontroller (STM32F446RE in my case), using open source tools and libraries such as GCC for ARM and STM HAL. The project purpuse is to build a bootloader for performing firmware updates over UART.

# DEBUGGER
In this project i've used the ST-Link DEBUGGER and Programmer attached to the board, in my case i've used NUCLEO STM32F446RE
